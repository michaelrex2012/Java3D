## Overview🗺️
Java3D is a 3D renderer I just decided to make one day. It can load 3D models and view them seamlessly. It isn't very useful, but I have big plans for it, and possibly model editing.
## Features📋
* Load built-in simple shapes.
* Load .obj or a custion .3djm file.
* Change background color.
* Toggle hiding/showing model.
* And more!
## Installation📦
Java3D can be installed from releases in this repo. It can be downloaded with a .exe installer or a .zip archive. Both installation options include a JRE (Temurin JRE 21.0.7+6) and some example models to load in Java3D.
